3. Environment & Energy (2000–2020)

Objective
- Track emissions, energy structure, air quality, forests and land use, water resources, and environmental economics to reveal China’s environmental turnaround.

Intro (page text)
- China’s growth reshaped its energy system and environment. Explore emissions, energy mix, air quality, forests, and water resources across 2000–2020.

Charts & Story
1) Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Two panels)
   Panel A: Total GHG (Gt CO2e) with policy milestones
   - Variables: Year → x; GHG total (Gt) → y.
   - Annotations: Kyoto implementation; policy shift around 2010.
   - Insight: steep rise early 2000s, later stabilization.
   Panel B: CO2 per Capita vs GDP per Capita (Scatter)
   - Variables: GDP pc (x) vs CO2 pc (y); color by Year.
   - Insight: income–emissions intensity tradeoff; decadal movement.

2) Greenhouse Gas Composition (Stacked area)
   - Components: CO2, CH4, N2O (Mt CO2e).
   - Insight: CO2 dominates; CH4 and N2O contribute smaller shares.

3) Energy Structure (Stacked area + Pie)
   - Electricity mix over time: Coal, Gas, Nuclear, Hydro, Renewables.
   - 2020 pie: snapshot of sources; Hydro vs other renewables separated.
   - Insight: gradual diversification and growth in renewables.

4) Renewable Energy Growth (Line with policy markers)
   - Variables: Renewable electricity share (% total).
   - Annotations: Blue Sky Action Plan (2013), Paris Agreement (2015).
   - Insight: acceleration in the 2010s.

5) Air Quality (Trend + Distribution)
   - PM2.5 (μg/m³) trend vs WHO/China reference lines; vertical markers for policy cycle (2013–2018).
   - Distribution (box with points) before/after 2015: shift toward lower levels.

6) Forest & Land Resources (Line + Pie)
   - Forest cover (% land) trend shows restoration.
   - Land use (pie, 2020): Agricultural, Arable, Forest, Other.

7) Water Resources (Line + Pie)
   - Water stress index trend with Low/Medium/High reference bands.
   - Water usage by sector (pie, 2020): Agriculture, Industry, Domestic.

8) Environmental Economics (Stacked area + Line)
   - Damage costs (% of GNI): CO2, PM, Energy depletion.
   - Green Savings (Adjusted Net National Savings % GNI): improvement over time.

9) Summary Index (Line)
   - Composite of normalized CO2 per capita (inverted), PM2.5 (inverted), and renewable share.
   - Insight: upward index → improving environmental performance.

Conclusion (page text)
- From 2000 to 2020, coal dependence eased while renewables scaled, PM2.5 declined after 2013 policies, forests expanded, and water stress remained a key constraint. China shows measurable progress toward a cleaner, more efficient energy system.

Design & Interaction
- Decade filter, consistent margins, subdued palette (greens/blues/grays), annotations for policies and thresholds.
