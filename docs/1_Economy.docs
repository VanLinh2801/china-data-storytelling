1. Economy (2000–2020)

Objective
- Explain China’s macroeconomic evolution: scale (GDP), growth dynamics, sector composition, investment-growth linkage, inflation patterns, demand composition, trade openness, and financial position.

Intro (page text)
- China underwent rapid economic growth and a structural shift. Explore GDP, sectors, investment, inflation, and demand composition.

Charts & Story
1) Topline Dynamics (Two panels)
   Left: GDP per capita (constant USD) and GDP per capita growth (%)
   - Variables: Year → x; level (const USD) → y1; growth (%) → y2.
   - Insight: Rising living standards with cyclical growth moderation over time.
   Right: GDP (Trillion USD) and GDP growth (%)
   - Variables: Year → x; GDP (T USD) → y1 (area); growth (%) → y2 (line).
   - Insight: Aggregate scale upshifts by an order of magnitude with growth cycles.

2) Investment vs Growth (Scatter with Decades)
   - Variables: Investment (% of GDP) → x; GDP growth (%) → y; Decade → color; OLS trendline.
   - Insight: Relationship between capital formation intensity and realized growth; decadal shift in efficiency.

3) Inflation: CPI vs GDP Deflator (Dual line)
   - Variables: CPI inflation (%) vs GDP deflator (%).
   - Insight: Consumer price vs broad price dynamics; episodes of overheating and stabilization.

4) Economic Composition (Treemap, year slider)
   - Variables: Household consumption, Government expenditure, Investment, Net exports (% GDP).
   - Insight: Internal vs external demand balance at selected year (commonly 2020).

5) GDP Sectors & Trade Openness (Side-by-side)
   - Sector Composition (% GDP) (stacked area): Agriculture → Industry → Services; structural upgrading toward services.
   - Exports & Imports (% GDP) (area): with WTO 2001 marker; integration then rebalancing.

6) Finance & External Position (optional panel set)
   - FDI vs GDP Growth (dual-axis): external investment and macro link.
   - External Debt vs Reserves (dual-axis): vulnerability vs buffer.
   - Current Account by Decade (box+points): distributional view.
   - Correlation Heatmap: FDI, trade, growth, debt, consumption correlations.

Conclusion (page text)
- From 2000 to 2020, China’s GDP grew more than tenfold, inflation remained generally controlled, and the economy shifted from manufacturing towards services.

Design & Interaction
- Consistent margins, decadal filters, horizontal legends, key-event annotations (e.g., WTO 2001).
