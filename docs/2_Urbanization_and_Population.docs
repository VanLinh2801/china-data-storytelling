2. Population (2000–2020)

Objective
- Explain population scale and growth, gender balance, age structure, employment composition, and the urban–rural split.

Intro (page text)
- Migration reshaped China’s demographics. Explore population levels and growth, gender ratios, age structure, employment, and urban–rural composition.

Charts & Story
1) Birth & Death Rates (Dual line)
   - Variables: Year → x; Birth rate (per 1,000) vs Death rate (per 1,000).
   - Insight: Demographic transition with declining births and relatively stable deaths.

2) Population & Population Growth (Dual-axis)
   - Variables: Population (billions, y1) and growth rate (%) (y2).
   - Insight: Very large population with decelerating growth.

3) Gender Analysis
   - Sex ratio (Male/Female) line; Sex ratio at birth with 1.05 reference line.
   - Insight: Long-run movement toward balance; still elevated in specific periods.

4) Age Structure (Stacked area) + Median Age
   - Groups: 0–14, 15–64, 65+; captures aging trend and shrinking working-age share.
   - Median Age (line) summarizes the demographic mix into a single trajectory.

5) Employment & Unemployment
   - Employment by sector (stacked area): agriculture → industry → services; modernization of the job mix.
   - Unemployment by gender (lines): cyclical dynamics and gaps.

6) Urban vs Rural Population
   - Urban (%) vs Rural (%) (dual area).
   - Insight: sustained urbanization; rural share declines.

7) Megacities Population Rate (Line)
   - Share in megacities; complements national urbanization narrative.

Conclusion (page text)
- China’s demographic transformation shows declining birth rates, stable death rates, and rapid urbanization. The population structure shifted toward older demographics with improved life expectancy and infrastructure development.
